# Further reading

Testing is a huge topic and could require enough materials for a whole training.
We will go back to component testing in the next few exercises.
In the meantime, if you want to learn more, you can read more about testing on [our blog](https://threedots.tech/tags/testing/).

After doing the full setup of component tests, it's not a big deal to add more tests.
We will not verify your tests in the following exercises, but we highly encourage you to write them.
At some point, we will come back to them!

When you are implementing functionality in a daily job, it often helps to start with writing tests, TDD-style.
