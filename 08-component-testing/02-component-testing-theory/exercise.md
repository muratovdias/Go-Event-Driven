# Component Testing

### Test Names Definition

Usually, the definition of _unit_ or _end-to-end (E2E) tests_ is clear for everyone, 
but we've seen a lot of misunderstanding about what _integration tests_ are.
It's even worse with _component tests_.

To start with, we need to be sure that we are on the same page with the definition of each type of test.

| Feature / Test Type           | Unit                       | Integration  | Component        | End-to-End |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------|------------------|------------|
| **Docker database**           | No                         | Yes          | Yes              | Yes        |
| **Use of external systems**      | No                         | No           | No               | Yes        |
| **Focused on business cases** | Depends on the tested code | No           | Yes              | Yes        |
| **Uses mocks**                | Most dependencies          | Usually none | External systems | None       |
| **Tested API**                | Go package                 | Go package   | HTTP and gRPC    | HTTP       |
| **Execution speed**           | Fast                       | Fast         | Medium           | Slow       |
| **Cost of introduction**      | \$                          | \$\$           | \$\$\$              | \$          |
| **Cost of maintenance**       | \$                          | \$\$           | \$\$               | \$\$\$\$       |

### Testing Strategies

Projects often start with a lot of unit and E2E tests because they are easy to introduce.
For very simple projects, relying on those tests may be enough. 
However, as the project grows in complexity, it becomes harder to maintain them.
Adding new features is also not easy, because E2E tests are slow and unit tests can't cover all features.
E2E tests are also usually harder to run locally, resulting in a longer development feedback loop.
It's very detrimental for your productivity when you can't verify that a feature you implemented works locally.

Component tests represent the missing link between unit and E2E tests.
In component tests, we test the integration between components of our application with a database mocked 
in Docker and mocked external dependencies.
Thanks to this, component tests are faster than E2E tests and do more testing than unit tests.
It's also easier to test edge cases for external dependencies â€” it's easier to achieve the expected behaviour of external systems.

### How to write component tests?

Component tests have some similarities to E2E tests.
For component tests, we need to start an entire application and test it by using the public API.
However, we want to mock external dependencies that we are not able to run in Docker.
In the case of our application, we will mock all APIs that we are reaching through Gateway.
As much as possible, we want to use real infrastructure in Docker.

This is what our infrastructure looks like in production.
(We are using just Redis, but it's likely that we'll need PostgreSQL in the future.)

Some time ago, our friend Krzysztof wrote a guest article on our blog on how to [generate C4 diagrams directly from Go code](https://threedots.tech/post/auto-generated-c4-architecture-diagrams-in-go/))._

To run component tests locally, we need to mock our external dependencies and run the required infrastructure locally.

### Which Features to Test in Component Tests?

For most projects that are similar to our application, the best strategy is to test the happy paths of each added feature in component tests. 
Edge cases and unhappy paths should be tested in unit tests. 
The most critical scenarios should also be tested with both E2E tests and component tests.

For example, the happy paths for features in our ticket application could be the following:
- A receipt is issued for a confirmed ticket.
- The "tickets-to-print" sheet is updated with a new row when a ticket is confirmed.
- The "tickets-to-refund" sheet is updated with a new row when a ticket is canceled.

Component tests should ideally be written before enabling the feature in production.

We're deliberately using the word "enabling" and not "deploying." We encourage you to use [trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com) and continuously deploy to production.

Now, let's write the component tests for our ticket application!

We know that there are companies that use dedicated QA teams for writing most of their tests.
We can't know all types of companies, but we believe that it's better to have the team of developers be responsible 
for writing most of the tests. 
This helps decrease the cycle time for developing the feature and gives more ownership to the team.
