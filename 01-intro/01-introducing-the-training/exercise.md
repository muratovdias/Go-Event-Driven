### The Format

This training is different than most online courses out there.
It's completely hands-on, with just the amount of theory needed. You progress through modules by solving exercises.

Each exercise uses a set of tests to verify your solution.
You won't see the code for most of the tests, but for some exercises, they're available, so you can see how they work.

Exercises come in two flavors:

* Simpler code snippets, where you learn how to do one specific thing.
* Longer-term updates to a project.

The project should give you a good overview of what event-driven patterns look like in real-life systems.
You will extend the project over all the modules.

### How to go through the training

If you can read this, you already have our `tdl` CLI installed.
There's only one command you need to run from now on to go to the next exercise:

```bash
tdl training run
```

Running it will verify your solution, and will let you proceed to the next exercise.

### Structure

You can read the exercise description and theory on this website.

In your local environment, you will find the exercise files you're going to change.
They will be sorted across directories with the module number and name.
It's the same structure as you can see in the sidebar on the right side of this page.

The long-running project you're going to work on will stay in the `project` directory.

Next to the exercise files, you'll also find a markdown file with the exercise description.
It's the same content as on the website, but you can read it in your editor.
We still recommend using the website for the best experience.

We also recommend keeping your entire project directory in a git repository.
We don't keep your solutions, so it's the best way to pick up the training on another computer.

### Solutions

If you get stuck, there will be a solution available on the exercise page.
Don't give up too quickly, though!
You will learn the most by trying to solve the exercises yourself.

The solution will also appear as soon as you solve the exercise and go to the next one.
(You need to go to the previous exercise to see it.)

### Getting Help

There's a Discord community for all participants in this training.
You can ask questions there and get help from other attendees and the authors.
Click the button with the Discord logo at the top of this page to join.

We consider the community to be the key part of the training.
You'll get access to a private group with channels for each module.
You can discuss your solutions there, ask for a review, or reach out for help if you can't figure something out.

### Getting Stuck

We wanted to recreate the experience of learning by building a complete project.
Just as in real life, there are many advanced concepts you need to grasp over time. 
We don't describe all of them in depth (that's what books are for).

If you ever get stuck or feel overwhelmed, it's part of the learning process.
You can always go back to the previous exercises, and review the solutions to understand what's going on.
Most importantly, we're available on the Discord channels to help you understand whatever's not clear.
